## Welcome {#welcome .unnumbered}

This document articulates a governance structure for the [Regional
Wildlife Science Collaborative for Offshore Wind](rwsc.org) (RWSC) as a
collaborative entity among four sectors ‚Äì federal agencies, state
agencies, environmental non-governmental organizations, and offshore
wind companies. The structure and processes described in this document
are meant to provide consistency in participation in RWSC where possible
across sectors while also allowing necessary flexibility for each
sector. This document and all of its sections will be reviewed and
re-adopted annually by the Steering Committee.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Mission  {.unnumbered}

To collaboratively and effectively conduct and coordinate relevant,
credible, and efficient regional monitoring and research of wildlife and
marine ecosystems that supports the advancement of environmentally
responsible and cost-efficient offshore wind power development
activities in U.S. Atlantic waters.

RWSC is serving as a coordination hub for offshore wind research to
increase collaboration, limit redundancy, suggest common data standards,
and increase data sharing and transparency.

### Scope {.unnumbered}

#### Geographic Area  {.unnumbered}

The geographic scope includes waters along the Northeast and Southeast
U.S. Continental Shelf in the areas where offshore wind development is
being developed or is proposed. RWSC shares organizational lessons
learned and makes available the science and data management
recommendations that are pertinent to other U.S. regions (e.g., the west
coast, Gulf of Mexico).

#### Wildlife Definition  {.unnumbered}

‚ÄúWildlife‚Äù includes marine mammals, sea turtles, protected fish species
and corals, birds, and bats. Additionally, for the purposes of RWSC,
wildlife are part of a complex ecosystem of various trophic levels
including all fisheries resources and benthic organisms, and
oceanographic drivers upon which the aforementioned species depend.

#### Scope of Inquiries  {.unnumbered}

The primary subject matter scope will initially include wildlife and
habitats (e.g., marine mammals, sea turtles and birds, bats, protected
fish species, corals, and the complex ecosystems in which affected
wildlife exist). RWSC will seek to coordinate with entities such as
Responsible Offshore Science Alliance (ROSA) on matters associated with
fisheries and other topics of commercial interest.

## History & Background  {#history}

The RWSC was formed in July 2021 following several years of planning,
facilitated discussions, and working sessions that included
representatives from the four sectors and other interested stakeholders.
During the pre-2021 planning phase, many of the key components of the
entity‚Äôs potential structure and governance were outlined in a
collaborative document, [Regional Wildlife Science Entity for Atlantic
Offshore Wind: A Stakeholder Driven
Vision](https://neoceanplanning.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/RWSE_Vision_2020.pdf).

A voluntary interim Steering Committee was convened to inform the
selection of a host entity and fiscal agent in early 2021. The Interim
Steering Committee used the Vision document as a blueprint for the
formation of the entity. When the Interim Steering Committee selected
the Northeast Regional Ocean Council, Mid-Atlantic Regional Council on
the Ocean, and Coastal States Stewardship Foundation as hosts and fiscal
agent, they all collectively began implementing the governance structure
as described in the Vision. The Interim Steering Committee transitioned
to a full standing Steering Committee, leveraging all of the same
individuals that had served as interim members. These members guided the
formation of the four Sector Caucuses and six expert Subcommittees
(Marine Mammals, Birds & Bats, Sea Turtles, Habitat & Ecosystem,
Protected Fish Species, and Technology).

After approximately two years of collaboration and discussions with the
research community, RWSC released the first [Integrated Science Plan for
Offshore Wind, Wildlife, and Habitat in U.S. Atlantic
Waters](http://rwsc.org/science-plan) (‚ÄúScience Plan‚Äù). The Science Plan
aggregates research and data needs from across the sectors, and
recommends data repositories and practices for data management that are
specific to each type of research or data. In addition, the Science Plan
describes a framework for collaboration among the sectors to support
regional offshore wind and wildlife research and implement the
recommendations in the Science Plan. One of the recommendations in the
Science Plan is to convene a new Data Governance Subcommittee that will
develop RWSC-wide policies for data management and sharing. With support
from RWSC staff, the Steering Committee is convening this new
Subcommittee in early 2024.

The Science Plan, including the framework for collaboration, and this
Governance Structure, will continue to be used to guide the work of the
RWSC.

## Organizational Components {#org}

This document is organized by the organizational components listed below
and shown in the RWSC org chart.

![](images/RWSC_Org_Chart.png){fig-align="left"}

1.  [Framework for Collaboration](index.qmd#framework) - A framework
    that describes the actions that the sectors can take to implement
    the Science Plan and use RWSC as a forum to collaborate on offshore
    wind and wildlife research.

2.  [Steering Committee](index.qmd#steering) - A group representing the
    key sectors. Provides guidance and direction for process and
    procedure of the RWSC overall, including to the Director and
    Subcommittees. Representatives are selected from Sector Caucuses.
    This section contains the Steering Committee Charter, to which all
    Steering Committee members agree.

3.  [Sector Caucuses](index.qmd#sectors) **‚Äì** Sector Caucuses provide
    input to the Steering Committee to ensure progress on strategic
    research on offshore wind and wildlife topics. Participation in
    Sector Caucuses involves regular virtual meetings and discussions
    within sectors (e.g. offshore wind industry; state government;
    federal government; and non-governmental environmental
    organizations). Each Sector Caucus has developed its own Framework
    to guide the creation and use of their caucus including a clear
    definition of membership or participation:

    -   [Offshore Wind Industry Caucus Framework](index.qmd#industry)

    -   [State Caucus Framework](index.qmd#state)

    -   [Federal Caucus Framework](index.qmd#federal)

    -   [eNGO Caucus Framework](index.qmd#engo)

4.  [Subcommittees](index.qmd#subcommittees) **‚Äì** Subcommittees are the
    core groups that identify key gaps and needs, scope initial research
    concepts initially, and help maintain alignment between ongoing
    research and the gaps and needs of the RWSC. Subcommittees are
    convened as needed. This section contains the generic Subcommittee
    Terms of Reference. RWSC staff also maintain a specific Terms
    document for each Subcommittee (referenced within).

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
5.  [Director, Other Staff, and Partners](index.qmd#staff) **‚Äì** Staff
    employed by RWSC with appropriate skills and competencies. The
    Director conducts day-to-day management of RWSC including planning
    events, coordinating the committees, brokering funding and in
    selected cases, managing research contracts. Partners are
    organizations who operate within the geographic area of interest and
    have objectives similar to those of the RWSC and/or complementary
    expertise.

6.  [RWSC Operations Host and Fiscal Agent](index.qmd#ops) **-** A
    Host/Fiscal Agent with functional administrative capacities that
    provides key functions for RWSC for a reasonable overhead cost.
    Provides infrastructure to execute administrative and financial
    duties to administer operational funds (e.g. RWSC staff contracts
    management). and research funding (e.g. letting contracts for
    specific services, and aggregating funding for research, as needed).

7.  [RWSC Offshore Wind & Wildlife Research Fund Fiscal
    Agent](index.qmd#research) **‚Äì** A Fiscal Agent with functional
    administrative capacities that provides key functions for RWSC for a
    reasonable overhead cost. Provides infrastructure to execute
    administrative and financial duties to administer research funds
    (e.g. aggregating funding for research, developing and managing
    subcontracts with research entities).

8.  Conflict of Interest Policy

9.  Harassment Policy

## 1. Framework for Collaboration {#framework}

The voluntary framework for collaboration among the RWSC sectors has
three primary goals:

1.  Promote coordination of regional offshore wind related wildlife
    research with the RWSC, regardless of funding source, recipient(s),
    or funding structure.

2.  Ensure that data collection and research methods and products (i)
    meet the needs of decision-makers, (ii) are scientifically
    sound, (iii) standardized, and (iv) made available for use as soon
    as feasible or appropriate to inform and improve decision-making.

3.  Communicate the findings and results of individual and collaborative
    research.

RWSC welcomes and encourages participation from all entities and
individuals in implementing this Science Plan, especially via expert
Subcommittee meetings. To assist in the implementation of the Science
Plan, the RWSC will maintain the¬†[Offshore Wind & Wildlife Research
Database](https://database.rwsc.org/)¬†and continue to provide tools and
forums for research planning, discussions, and collaboration among all
participants. All are encouraged to participate in implementing the
Science Plan by:

-   **Maintaining situational awareness of data collection and research
    activities to identify opportunities for collaboration, consistency,
    and efficiency.** This can be accomplished in part by participating
    regularly in RWSC Sector Caucus and expert Subcommittee meetings and
    by encouraging relevant grantees, contractors, and researchers to
    share project information with the RWSC. Several RWSC participants
    have noted the value of Subcommittee meetings as forums for sharing
    research plans, discussing emerging issues, and working together
    across sectors to advance Science Plan objectives. The Subcommittees
    will continue to meet regularly to share information on the latest
    study results, ongoing and planned research and data collection, and
    to periodically review data management infrastructure needs and
    workflows. Entities will be able to coordinate as needed with the
    relevant RWSC Subcommittee(s) prior to new data collection (to
    ensure consistency and reduce duplication) and analysis (to
    facilitate access to the available data) and share details about
    where and when activities take place to avoid conflicts. The RWSC
    will facilitate this objective via the¬†[Offshore Wind & Wildlife
    Research Database](https://database.rwsc.org/), web mapping tools,
    and a data catalog (in development).

-   **Collaboratively implementing and encouraging the use of best
    practices for data collection, QA/QC, data management, and storage
    as specified in this Science Plan.** Each Subcommittee has
    recommended practices for each relevant data type or data collection
    method in the Science Plan. To encourage uptake and consistent use
    of these practices, the RWSC will provide suggested language, agreed
    to by the Sector Caucuses, around data management for participants
    to use in their own requests for proposals and agreements.

-   **Participating in annual discussions of research priorities.** The
    RWSC provides a forum to identify data and research needs based on
    current data gaps, new research results, emerging decision-making
    needs, and available funding. To facilitate an adaptive approach to
    prioritizing the recommendations in the Science Plan, RWSC will
    convene the sectors each year to review and discuss research
    priorities. Discussions will be informed by the expert
    Subcommittees‚Äô work, collaborative workshops, and agreed upon
    prioritization criteria.

-   **Aligning funds and developing collaborative funding plans.**
    Through annual research prioritization discussions, the RWSC will
    provide opportunities for participants to voluntarily align their
    existing research funds to address Science Plan objectives when it
    makes sense to do so. The RWSC also provides a mechanism for pooling
    funds to accomplish shared priorities when practical, administering
    funds, and managing research projects that accomplish Science Plan
    goals.

## 2. Steering Committee Charter {#steering}

***What.*** The Steering Committee will provide governance and oversight
on the processes and procedures of the RWSC. The Steering Committee will
be the final decision-making body on process, financial, and procedural
governance of the RWSC.

***Key Functions.*** The Steering Committee will meet via teleconference
at least quarterly and will exchange communications with the Director
and each other via email on a more frequent basis. The Steering
Committee provides general guidance and oversight to the Subcommittees,
Fiscal Agent and Director, including:

-   Liaise with existing and related science efforts that Steering
    Committee members may be part of

-   Establish and maintain two-way communication with sectors on RWSC
    progress, development, and direction

-   Provide guidance to the Director on refining near-term objectives
    for the RWSC

-   Provide criteria for how and what kind of research the RWSC supports

-   Provide oversight on the establishment of funding of the operations
    of the RWSC

-   Establish roles and approaches to membership for Subcommittees

-   Based on Subcommittee recommendation, approve plans to align
    research with gaps and needs assessment

-   Provide input on cross-cutting issues like data standardization,
    stressors and impacts as needed

-   With support and assistance from RWSC staff, lead regular Caucus
    discussions

***Number and composition.*** The Steering Committee will include a
maximum of twelve (12) members, composed of three (3) representatives
each from the four sectors listed below. Members will be nominated by
their respective Sector Caucus to represent that Caucus on the Steering
Committee.¬†

-   wind energy developers and lease-holders

-   environmental nonprofits

-   federal agencies, and

-   states

To the extent possible and/or practical, members of the Steering
Committee will be representative of the full geographic region
encompassed by the RWSC. Steering Committee members should have
influence on the strategy, objectives, and/or resources of their
organization.

***Term.*** Every member will serve for a maximum three (3) year term,
which will begin immediately upon acceptance of this Governance
Structure by the Interim Steering Committee. Each Sector Caucus has
defined processes and considerations for selecting and maintaining their
leadership (see [Sector Caucus Frameworks](index.qmd#sectors)), with
support and assistance from RWSC staff.¬† Should an individual Steering
Committee member exit the Committee before their term ends, the Sector
Caucus will appoint a replacement representative to fill the remainder
of that term.

***Decision-making.*** Steering Committee decisions are made by
consensus - no sector can ‚Äúout vote‚Äù or form a ‚Äúwinning coalition‚Äù
against another sector.

The Steering Committee intends to collectively make decisions about
which research to fund using the Science Plan, which articulates shared
research priorities, and through the establishment of an RWSC Offshore
Wind and Wildlife Research Fund. It is likely that Science Plan
recommendations will be funded by a combination of individual entities
that collaborate via RWSC and by funding provided to the RWSC Offshore
Wind and Wildlife Research Fund specifically for Science Plan
implementation. Funds provided to RWSC may be pooled from several
individual sources. For funds provided to RWSC, funding decisions will
reside with the Steering Committee, informed by the expert Subcommittees
and Science Plan, considering any limitations on the use of funds, and
funders‚Äô priorities.

***Steering Committee Member Responsibilities.*** General
responsibilities for representatives on the Steering Committee include:

1.  With support from RWSC staff, provide a forum for Sector Caucus
    members to meet and discuss items either to be raised to the
    Steering Committee, or that have been raised by the Steering
    Committee.

2.  Attend and meaningfully contribute to regular virtual discussions
    (at minimum, quarterly). If a Steering Committee member is unable to
    join a discussion, they may appoint a replacement representative
    from their organization to attend in their stead.

3.  Speak on behalf of their sector caucus, not just their individual
    organization.

4.  Be willing to engage in collaborative, cross-sector deliberations;
    and

5.  Contribute resources to the operating needs of RWSC as determined
    through coordination with the Director.

## 3. Sector Caucuses {#sectors}

Sector caucuses will involve standing meetings and listserv discussions
within sectors. Sector caucuses will be created for the **following four
sectors: wind energy developers and lease-holders; state government;
federal government; and environmental non-governmental organizations
(eNGOs).** Each sector has developed a Framework to guide participation,
membership, and leadership of that caucus. Each sector‚Äôs Frameworks are
included below. Current caucus rosters will be posted and updated on the
RWSC website.

***Key Functions.*** The sector caucuses will serve several purposes for
the RWSC. Their overall role is to provide input to the Steering
Committee to ensure progress on strategic research on offshore wind and
wildlife topics.¬† Each Caucus developed their own Frameworks with
responsibilities outlined, but the general function of the sector
caucuses include:

-   Select three (3) members from their Caucus to represent the Caucus
    on the Steering Committee. Each Steering Committee member will serve
    a maximum three (3) year term. Each Caucus should address Steering
    Committee membership individually and may have different criteria or
    methods for designating Steering Committee members.

-   Identify and sustain an approach to provide funding for the
    operations of the RWSC.

-   Provide a forum for all sector members to:

    -   Engage, share, learn, and keep abreast of RWSC work.

    -   Identify sector opportunities, issues or concerns that can be
        raised to the Steering Committee via Steering Committee sectoral
        representatives.

    -   Allow Steering Committee representatives to pose questions,
        issues, and ideas from the Steering Committee to the sectors.

***Who*****.** The current list of Caucus members is on the RWSC
website. Membership is meant to be clear but not onerous or overly
formal. Members need only to agree to support the general mission and
principles of the RWSC and to participate and engage in their caucus and
in periodic or occasional RWSC activities or events. If members
participate in scoping and conceptual approaches to research, they could
be precluded from bidding on work or precluded in playing a role in
final procurements and selection processes. The Steering Committee has
developed a Conflict of Interest policy applicable to all members to
address this issue.

***Number*****.** The number of caucus members may vary by sector,
however, should be manageable enough to facilitate efficient yet
comprehensive input.

***Decision-making.*** The caucuses have an option to utilize Consensus
Procedure. Each caucus‚Äô decision-making process is specified in their
individual Frameworks.

***Criteria for Membership.*** While each Caucus will develop its own
framework for operating, in general, caucus members should be able to:

-   **Attend meetings.** Attend and actively participate in regular
    caucus meetings;

-   **Complete follow-up work.** Complete any follow up actions or
    reviews as determined through caucus meetings;

-   **Attend events.** Participate in RWSC events as required, but not
    envisaged to exceed more than two events annually (events may
    include state of the science meetings and research funding
    prioritization meetings);

-   **Communicate with sector.** Ensure partners are well informed of
    current and relevant advancements;

-   **Provide expert guidance.** Provide ad hoc guidance on projects.

***Financial Contribution to RWSC Operating Budget***

For at least the next few fiscal years, there is a need for financial
support of RWSC operations which includes convening all RWSC members and
stakeholders (Steering Committee, four Sector Caucuses, Subcommittees)
and developing science plans/research agendas that describe data needs
and research priorities with each taxa-based Subcommittee. The Annual
Work Plan describes the scope of this work and the services provided by
RWSC staff, along with a budget. The Annual Work Plan and FY 2022 budget
was approved by the RWSC interim Steering Committee in September 2021.

The RWSC Governance Structure encourages members from the four Sector
Caucuses to contribute to the operational costs of the RWSC, in the form
of financial or documented in-kind contributions. Each Caucus is
developing a contribution model. Financial contributions to the RWSC
annual operating budget are not required but are strongly encouraged.

***Financial Contribution to RWSC Offshore Wind and Wildlife Research
Fund***

As of March 2024, a Research Budget has not been developed. With the
finalization of the RWSC Science Plan in January of 2024, the Caucus
expects to discuss research funding prioritization among themselves and
with other Caucuses throughout in 2024.¬†

***Conflict of Interest***

The RWSC Steering Committee has developed a Conflict of Interest Policy
that all Sector Caucus members are expected to comply with. For example,
if members participate in scoping and conceptual approaches to research,
they could be precluded from bidding on work or precluded in playing a
role in final procurements and selection processes. RWSC Staff, Steering
Committee members, and Subcommittee members are all subject to the same
policy.

### Offshore Wind Industry Caucus Framework {#industry}

***Offshore Wind Industry Caucus Definitions***

The table below briefly summarizes a membership and leadership model for
the Offshore Wind Industry Caucus developed in late 2021 and refined in
early 2023. Each component is further described in the following
sections. This is the first membership model implemented by the Caucus
and it was designed to be flexible in the first year of RWSC operations.
The Caucus will reevaluate this model at least annually and more
frequently as needed.¬†¬†

***Offshore Wind Industry Caucus Membership***

The RWSC Offshore Wind Industry Caucus welcomes membership and
participation from all levels of the industry from entities with
interests or potential interests in the Atlantic coast region and that
support the general mission and principles of the RWSC.

For the purposes of Offshore Wind Industry Caucus Membership, an
‚Äúentity‚Äù should:¬†

-   Have US Atlantic offshore wind lease interests, or

-   Have the intent to obtain a US Atlantic offshore wind lease
    interest(s), or

-   Be an eligible bidder on a US Atlantic offshore wind lease, or

-   Hold no current lease interest but express a commitment to
    understanding offshore wind and wildlife research and how it can
    advance the industry¬†

It is understood that a single entity may fit into one or more of the
entity categories described above or change categories throughout the
term of their Caucus participation. Membership of a Joint Venture in
RWSC does not confer individual Membership status to its parent
companies.¬†

Each Caucus Member will designate a primary staff member and an
alternate to represent the entity in Caucus discussions and voting.
Primary and alternate Members will be added to the Caucus mailing list
and receive invites to all Caucus meetings. Members will be provided
access to relevant Caucus documents and other materials.¬†

Caucus Members are expected to participate in regular meetings and
complete any follow up actions or reviews as determined through those
meetings. It is also expected that Caucus Members participate in RWSC
events as required, but not envisaged to exceed more than two events
annually (events may include a State of the Science Workshop or Annual
Forums).¬†

Members will be added to the Caucus mailing list and receive invites to
all Caucus meetings. In consultation with Caucus leadership, Members
will be provided access to relevant Caucus documents and other
materials.

***Offshore Wind Industry Caucus Membership***

Caucus Members have US Atlantic coast business interests, have voting
status, and are eligible for roles on the Steering Committee. Financial
contribution to the RWSC annual operating budget is a consideration but
not a requirement for Steering Committee eligibility. Financial
contribution to the RWSC annual operation budget by Caucus Members is
strongly encouraged.

***Maintaining existing Offshore Wind Industry Caucus Member
information***

This Offshore Wind Industry Caucus Framework recognizes that Member
entities‚Äô statuses will likely change over time, including changes in
ownership, the formation of new joint ventures, and other changes.
Member entities will notify RWSC staff and Caucus leadership about
changes to entity name, status, or representation on the Caucus.¬†

***Offshore Wind Industry - Onboarding new Members***

RWSC Staff will work with Caucus leadership to review new Caucus
Membership requests to ensure that new entities‚Äô interests are
consistent with this Framework and the RWSC Mission. As appropriate and
as determined by the Caucus leads, the Caucus may vote on the inclusion
of any new entity to the Caucus.¬†

***Offshore Wind Industry Caucus Voting***

This Framework recognizes that Caucus Members will represent overlapping
and duplicative interests. As such, the Caucus will make consensus-based
decisions to the extent practicable. On feedback and advice on
substantive issues, the Caucus may report a range of views if the
Members are not in general agreement. Voting procedures will be used
when determined necessary by Caucus leadership. Caucus members (entities
that provide financial contributions to the RWSC operations budget) have
voting status.¬†

***Offshore Wind Industry Caucus Leadership ‚Äì Steering Committee
Eligibility***

Caucus Members are eligible for roles as Caucus leads and to represent
the Caucus on the Steering Committee. The Caucus will select Members to
represent the Caucus on the Steering Committee for a term of two years.
One Steering Committee position will rotate each year, so that terms are
staggered.

-   Three primary Caucus leads/Steering Committee members must be
    selected by Caucus Members. Each selected Caucus lead/Steering
    Committee member should also designate an alternate from their
    entity. Alternates may join Steering Committee voting procedures
    only if the primary member is unable to participate.¬†¬†

-   Caucus Members may consider the following factors when they
    determine the balance of Caucus representation on the Steering
    Committee:¬†

    -   Entity type (lease holder, developer, other)¬†

    -   Entity‚Äôs relationship(s) with other potential Caucus
        leads/Steering Committee members‚Äô entities¬†

    -   Geographic scope of entity‚Äôs interests¬†

    -   Contributions to RWSC annual operating budget

-   Members of the Caucus will nominate Steering Committee
    representatives as positions on the Steering Committee become
    available. Representatives will be chosen by blind vote.¬†¬†

-   Responsibilities:

    -   Represent the entire Offshore Wind Industry Sector Caucus in
        Steering Committee meetings and discussions. This includes
        discussions and decisions regarding RWSC operations, research
        prioritization, and funding.¬†

    -   Serve as Caucus leads: Caucus representatives on the RWSC
        Steering Committee are expected to lead and coordinate the
        Caucus. Administrative support (e.g., taking notes, developing
        draft meeting summaries, drafting other caucus materials) will
        be provided by RWSC Staff.¬†¬†

    -   Communicate with Caucus Members: Steering Committee members are
        responsible for coordinating, soliciting, and collating the
        review, discussion, and input of the entire Caucus on any
        documents, information, or other decisions conveyed by RWSC
        staff¬†

***Offshore Wind Industry Caucus - Financial Contribution Structure
(RWSC operating budget only)***

Financial contributions to the RWSC annual operating budget are not
required but are strongly encouraged. For at least the next few fiscal
years, there is a need for financial support of RWSC operations which
includes convening all RWSC members and stakeholders (i.e., Steering
Committee, four Sector Caucuses, six Subcommittees) and developing
science plans/research agendas that describe data needs and research
priorities with each taxa-based Subcommittee. The [Annual Work
Plan](http://rwsc.org/about) describes the scope of this work and the
services provided by RWSC staff, along with a budget.

The RWSC Governance Structure encourages members from the four Sector
Caucuses to contribute to the operational costs of the RWSC, in the form
of financial or documented in-kind contributions. Each Caucus is
developing a contribution model.¬†

Since July 2022, the Offshore Wind Industry Caucus has sought to fund up
to 33% of the RWSC operations budget. This has translated to an annual
contribution of \$20,000 per entity. This contribution will be
recalculated annually based on budget projections and the total number
of member entities. As such, the contribution per entity will be reduced
as more members join the Caucus.¬†

Contributions will be invoiced to each entity annually as Membership
Dues. Members joining mid-year will be invoiced for the minimum
contribution for that fiscal year. An optional renewal for each fiscal
year (which begins on July 1) will be sent each June.¬†

***Offshore Wind Industry Caucus - Financial Contribution to RWSC
Offshore Wind and Wildlife Research Fund***

As of March 2024, a Research Budget has not been developed. With the
finalization of the RWSC Science Plan in January of 2024, the Caucus
expects to discuss research funding prioritization among themselves and
with other Caucuses throughout in 2024.¬†

***Conflict of Interest***

The RWSC Steering Committee has developed a Conflict of Interest Policy
that all Sector Caucus members are expected to comply with. For example,
if members participate in scoping and conceptual approaches to research,
they could be precluded from bidding on work or precluded in playing a
role in final procurements and selection processes. RWSC Staff, Steering
Committee members, and Subcommittee members are all subject to the same
policy.

### State Caucus Framework {#state}

***State Caucus Membership***

The RWSC State Caucus welcomes membership and participation from all
states in the Atlantic coast region and that support the general mission
and principles of the RWSC. Participants must be employees of state
agencies or departments with responsibilities related to wildlife,
offshore wind, or both. Multiple individuals from each state may
participate in the Caucus.

Caucus Members have voting status and are eligible for roles on the
Steering Committee. Each Member state must designate a single individual
to represent the state during Caucus discussions and decision making.

Caucus Members are expected to participate in Caucus meetings and
complete any follow up actions or reviews as determined during those
meetings. It is also expected that Caucus Members participate in RWSC
events as appropriate, but not envisaged to exceed more than two events
annually (events may include a State of the Science Workshop or Annual
Forums).

Members will be added to the Caucus mailing list and receive invites to
all Caucus meetings. In consultation with Caucus leadership, Members
will be provided access to relevant Caucus documents and other
materials.

***State Sector Caucus - Onboarding New Members***

RWSC staff will work with Caucus leadership to review new Caucus
Membership requests to ensure that new entities‚Äô interests are
consistent with this Framework and the RWSC Mission. As appropriate and
as determined by the Caucus leads, the Caucus may vote on the inclusion
of any new entity to the Caucus.

***State Sector Caucus Voting***

The State Sector Caucus will make consensus-based decisions. On feedback
and advice on substantive issues, the caucus may report a range of views
if the sector is not in general agreement. Voting procedures will be
used when determined necessary by Caucus leadership. Caucus members
(states that provide financial contributions to the RWSC operations
budget) have voting status.

***State Sector Caucus Leadership ‚Äì Steering Committee Eligibility***

In accordance with the RWSC Governance Structure, each Sector Caucus
will select members to represent the Caucus on the Steering Committee
for a maximum term of three years. One Steering Committee position will
rotate each year, so that terms are staggered.

-   Three primary Caucus leads/Steering Committee members must be
    selected by Caucus Members. Each selected Caucus lead/Steering
    Committee member should also designate an alternate from their
    state. Alternates may join Steering Committee voting procedures only
    if the primary member is unable to participate.

-   The three Steering Committee members should be from different states
    covering the geographic diversity of the RWSC to the extent
    practicable. The caucus may periodically revisit the three entities
    representing the caucus on the Steering Committee and make changes
    using the Consensus Procedure.

-   Members of the State Sector Caucus will nominate Steering Committee
    representatives as positions on the Steering Committee become
    available. Representatives will be chosen by blind vote.

**Responsibilities:**

-   Represent the entire State Caucus in Steering Committee meetings and
    discussions. This includes discussions and decisions regarding RWSC
    operations, research prioritization, and funding.

-   Convene Sector Meetings: Sector Caucus representatives on the RWSC
    Steering Committee are expected to lead and coordinate the caucus,
    with support from RWSC Staff.

-   Communicate with Sector: Steering Committee members are responsible
    for coordinating, soliciting, and collating the review, discussion,
    and input of the entire caucus on any documents, information, or
    other decisions conveyed by RWSC staff.

***State Sector Caucus - Financial Contribution Structure (RWSC
operations budget only)***

Financial contributions to the RWSC annual operating budget are not
required but are strongly encouraged.

For at least the next few fiscal years, there is a need for financial
support of RWSC operations which includes convening all RWSC members and
stakeholders (i.e., Steering Committee, four Sector Caucuses, six
Subcommittees) and developing science plans/research agendas that
describe data needs and research priorities with each taxa-based
Subcommittee. The Annual Work Plan describes the scope of this work and
the services provided by RWSC staff, along with a budget. The Annual
Work Plan and FY 2022 budget was approved by the RWSC interim Steering
Committee in September 2021.

The RWSC Governance Structure encourages members from the four Sector
Caucuses to contribute to the operational costs of the RWSC, in the form
of financial or documented in-kind contributions. Each Caucus is
developing a contribution model.

***State Sector Caucus - Financial Contribution to Research Funds***

As of March 2022, a Research Budget has not been developed. Following
the finalization of and RWSC Science Plan, staff and the Steering
Committee will seek input on funding priorities and project management
costs to develop a Research Budget. The Caucus will reevaluate
Membership and contribution criteria and expectations at this time.¬†

### Federal Caucus Framework {#federal}

***Federal Sector Caucus - Membership Criteria***

While the number of members may vary over time, the total number of
Federal Sector Caucus participants should be manageable to facilitate
efficient yet comprehensive input. Expectations for membership are
listed below.

**Who.** Federal Sector Caucus members must be directly affiliated with
a federal agency and support the general mission and principles of the
RWSC.

-   **Meeting and Event Participation.** Sector caucuses will involve
    standing meetings and listserv discussions. Caucus members are
    expected to participate in regular meetings and complete any follow
    up actions or reviews as determined through those meetings. It is
    also expected that Caucus members participate in RWSC events as
    appropriate but not envisaged to exceed more than two events
    annually (events may include a State of the Science Workshop or
    Annual Forums).

-   **Contributions to RWSC Operations**. If they possess appropriate
    legal authority, Federal Sector Caucus members may provide
    operational support to the RWSC, in the form of financial or
    documented in-kind contributions. Each agency may independently
    explore elective measures to provide support to the RWSC.

-   **Conflict of Interest.** The RWSC Steering Committee has developed
    a Conflict of Interest Policy that all Sector Caucus members are
    expected to comply with. For example, if members participate in
    scoping and conceptual approaches to research, they could be
    precluded from bidding on work or precluded in playing a role in
    final procurements and selection processes. RWSC Staff, Steering
    Committee members, and Subcommittee members are subject to the same
    policy.

***Federal Sector Caucus - Decision-making***

The Federal Sector Caucus will make consensus-based decisions. If
consensus cannot be achieved on substantive issues, the caucus may
report this non-consensus and, if appropriate, the range of views held
by the sector members.

***Federal Sector Caucus - Steering Committee Representation***

In accordance with the RWSC Governance Structure, each Sector Caucus
will select members to represent the Caucus on the Steering Committee
for a maximum term of three years. The interim Steering Committee
includes volunteers from NOAA and BOEM. The RWSC Staff recommend that
the first iteration of the Steering Committee include Federal
representatives from NOAA, BOEM, and USFWS. The caucus may periodically
revisit the three entities representing the caucus on the Steering
Committee and make changes using the Consensus Procedure. Steering
Committee membership will be reviewed at the end of each calendar year,
at which time new Steering Committee representation may be selected,
depending upon term limits of the incumbent representatives.

-   **Number.** Three primary members must be selected, and three
    alternates may also be designated. Alternate members should be from
    the same entity as the primary member. Alternates may participate in
    Steering Committee meetings. Alternates may participate in voting
    procedures only if the primary member is unable to participate.

-   **Who.** Steering Committee members should be from different federal
    entities, have professional responsibilities related to offshore
    wind and wildlife, and represent the geographic diversity of the
    RWSC to the extent practicable.

-   **Selection process.** Each representative agency of the Federal
    Sector Caucus will nominate Steering Committee representatives as
    positions on the Steering Committee become available.
    Representatives will be chosen by consensus of the caucus.

-   **Responsibilities.**

    -   *Convene Sector Meetings:* Sector Caucus representatives on the
        RWSC Steering Committee are expected to lead and coordinate the
        caucuses, with support from RWSC Staff.

    -   *Communicate with Sector:* Steering Committee members are
        responsible for coordinating, soliciting, and collating the
        review, discussion, and input of the entire caucus on any
        documents, information, or other decisions conveyed by RWSC
        staff.

### eNGO Caucus Framework {#engo}

***eNGO Sector Caucus Membership Criteria***

While the number of members may vary over time, the total number of eNGO
Sector Caucus participants should be managed to facilitate efficient yet
comprehensive input. Expectations for membership are listed below.

**Who.** eNGO Sector Caucus members must be directly affiliated with an
environmental non-governmental organization that is working to advance
responsible offshore wind in a manner that protects ocean and coastal
wildlife and habitats and must support the general mission and
principles of the RWSC. While anyone in the Caucus may join caucus
meetings, only one individual from each entity may represent that entity
in discussions and/or decision-making.¬†¬†

**Meeting and Event Participation.** Sector Caucus members should
participate in the Caucus‚Äô standing meetings, which will be held no less
than quarterly, listserv discussions, and complete any follow up actions
or reviews as determined through those meetings. It is also expected
that Caucus members participate in RWSC events as required, but not
envisaged to exceed more than two events annually (events may include a
State of the Science Workshop or an Annual Forum)¬†

**Conflict of Interest.** The RWSC Steering Committee has developed a
Conflict of Interest Policy that Sector Caucus members are expected to
comply with. For example, if members participate in scoping and
conceptual approaches to research, they could be precluded from playing
a role in final procurements and selection processes. The Steering
Committee has developed a Conflict of Interest policy applicable to all
members to address this issue.

***eNGO Sector Caucus -*** ***Decision-making***

## 4. Subcommittees {#subcommittees}

### Terms of Reference

***Purpose.*** RWSC Subcommittees provide topic-area scientific and
technical experts from academia, state government, NGOs, and industry to
the Steering Committee. Subcommittees will initially be set up by taxon
(see below), and may be created, rearranged, combined, and/or
reconstituted as issues arise. RWSC Subcommittees will be connected to
existing NROC/MARCO Marine Life Work Groups such that they are distinct
but complementary, with beneficial overlap in membership towards
streamlining workflows such that research prioritization and data
collection result in shared data products that support decision-making
and adaptive management and vice-versa. RWSC Subcommittees and
NROC/MARCO Marine Life Work Groups may hold joint meetings when it is
beneficial to advancing offshore wind monitoring/assessment topics.

***Responsibilities.*** Each Subcommittee will meet virtually 2-3 times
per year, and more frequently when planning workshops, and coordinate
with other Subcommittees on common research and monitoring topics prior
to recommendations on research. The RWSC Coordinator will provide
support to Subcommittees in coordinating meetings. Subcommittee members
will contribute to a data/research gaps and needs assessment for their
Subcommittee. Subcommittees review existing research and data and
identify gaps and needs pertinent to offshore wind development and
wildlife. Subcommittees may support scoping conceptual research projects
that would address the gaps and needs. Subcommittees submit
recommendations on gaps and needs and potential projects to the Steering
Committee.

***Membership.*** The Director will maintain a list of potential
organizations for membership in each Subcommittee for input and approval
by the Steering Committee. Invitations are issued to selected
organizations (not necessarily those who are already part of the RWSC
via other representation) who would self-appoint individuals based on
guidance drafted by the Steering Committee. Subcommittee members must
have working knowledge of ongoing and pending wildlife and offshore wind
research as well as recent studies, workshops, and other efforts to
identify and prioritize research needs. Subcommittee member numbers and
numbers by sectors are less subject to exact requirements as long as
there is the necessary scientific expertise included and all sectors‚Äô
interests are meaningfully represented.

***Subcommittees.*** Other Subcommittees may be formed when a specific
issue or topic has been identified as a research priority.

-   Marine mammals

-   Sea turtles

-   Birds and bats

-   Protected fish species

-   Habitat and ecosystem

-   Technology

-   Data Governance

-   Other taxa-specific or cross-cutting issues as they arise

***Conflicts of Interest.*** If experts participate in scoping and
conceptual approaches to research, they could be precluded from bidding
on work or precluded in playing a role in final procurements and
selection processes. The Steering Committee has developed a Conflict of
Interest policy which will apply to all Subcommittees to address this
issue.

## 5. Director, Other Staff, and Partners  {#staff}

***What***. The Director plays a leadership role and has both scientific
and strong relationship and project management skills. The Director will
coordinate with the Host/Fiscal Agent, other staff, and partners. The
Steering Committee will assist the Director in determining what
additional staff and/or consultants may be needed over time to both
stand up the RWSC and deliver on projects, as funding becomes available.
As the volume of work grows, this position may be divided between a
Science Director and a Process Director.

***Key Functions.*** Selected functions of the Director and other staff
are outlined below.

-   Organize all events or workshops, conduct initial research on data
    and science gaps, and organize all communications and facilitation
    amongst the steering committee, sub-committees, stakeholders, and
    general public.

-   Key role in helping the sectors and organizations identify funding
    for key gaps and needs, including brokering partnerships or joint
    funding for projects of interest.

-   Conduct communications and marketing, including using targeted
    tools.

-   In selected cases in which the RWSC is procuring and contracting
    research, the Director and staff would provide contract management

-   Support the Subcommittees and Steering Committee with an initial
    screening of potential research projects based on the objectives of
    the RWSC (e.g. regional, data standardization, data transparency,
    etc.)

***Who.*** The Director will have at least a master‚Äôs or PhD in wildlife
biology, marine resource management, marine ecology, public policy,
environmental planning, or closely related disciplines.

***Other Staff.*** A variety of functions/roles will be needed to
support the Director and Steering Committee (outreach/engagement,
technical, accounting, legal, communications, etc.), for which
additional staff may be required.¬†

-   ***Coordinator**.* The RWSC Coordinator will directly support the
    RWSC Director and Steering Committee to advance the RWSC work plan.
    The Coordinator will assist the Director in managing contracts and
    work plans, convening the Sector Caucuses and Subcommittees, conduct
    additional as-needed outreach to existing and potential new
    partners, identify potential sources of funding, and support the
    Steering Committee.¬†

-   In consultation with the Steering Committee, staff may be directly
    hired through the Host/Fiscal Agent, or by partnering with other
    organizations such as universities, consultants, or other
    organizations.¬†

***Partners.*** Organizations, as determined by the Host/Fiscal Agent
and Director, in consultation with the Steering Committee, who operate
within the geographic area of interest and have objectives similar to
those of the RWSC and/or complementary expertise, and who:¬†

-   Can provide coordination and other capacity

-   Have a role in advancing the objectives of any Subcommittee

-   May provide staff via contractual or other means

## 6. RWSC Operations Hosts and Fiscal Agent  {#ops}

The Hosts and Fiscal Agent provide the core administrative and financial
functions of RWSC. In April 2021, the Interim Steering Committee
selected the Northeast Regional Ocean Council (NROC), Mid-Atlantic
Regional Council on the Ocean (MARCO), and Coastal States Stewardship
Foundation (CSSF) as hosts and fiscal agent for RWSC.

As hosts of RWSC, NROC and MARCO, supported by CSSF as their fiscal
agent, have responsibility for the programmatic, contractual, staffing,
fiscal, and legal oversight of the entity. As such, NROC and MARCO
support the RWSC Steering Committee in implementing the RWSC mission.
NROC and MARCO are responsible for the hiring of a Director in
consultation with the Steering Committee. NROC and MARCO provide
appropriate oversight of the Director‚Äôs work to manage the RWSC budget,
contracts, grants, and staffing to ensure that RWSC has sufficient
capacity such that regional wildlife and offshore wind research, grant
and contract, and fiscal administrative objectives can be met.

CSSF, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit entity, serves as RWSC‚Äôs fiscal agent,
consistent with Memoranda of Understanding with NROC and MARCO. In
practice this means that CSSF is the vehicle through which staffing,
contracts, and grants for RWSC are executed and managed. CSSF will
receive and remit payments on behalf of RWSC for services rendered and
funds received. This includes:

-   Providing a vehicle to maintain operating funding ‚Äì funds received
    by members for implementing the RWSC Annual Work Plan

-   In selected cases, accepting and pooling funds from multiple sources
    for research

-   Procure and contract for research as needed

## 7. RWSC Offshore Wind and Wildlife Research Fund Fiscal Agent  {#research}

A Research Fund Fiscal Agent provides the administrative and financial
functions of the Research Fund, including developing and executing
agreements with funders, holding and potentially pooling large sums of
funding from multiple sources, and developing, executing, and managing
contractual agreements with multiple types of entities to conduct
research. In July 2023, the Steering Committee selected the Center for
Ocean Leadership (COL) to serve as a partner and provide the
administrative, fiscal, and program management functions needed to
implement the RWSC Offshore Wind and Wildlife Research Fund on a
case-by-case basis.

The Center for Ocean Leadership became a University Corporation for
Atmospheric Research (UCAR) Community Program in 2022 to support the
ongoing work of the ocean science community. It is a convener and
coordinator for ocean science, working with more than 85 affiliated
institutions and federal agencies across the government. Center for
Ocean Leadership-affiliated institutions span the academic, industry,
and nonprofit sectors engaged in ocean science, technology development,
and public education. The roles and responsibilities of RWSC and
UCAR/COL in implementing the Research Fund are detailed in a [Memorandum
of
Understanding](https://rwsc.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/RWSC-UCAR-COL-20230721-MOU-Fully-Executed.pdf).
Briefly:

-   RWSC will serve in a technical, programmatic oversight, and
    decision-making role for identifying funding sources, approving the
    acceptance of funds, and selecting projects for funding with the
    purpose of implementing the RWSC Science Plan.

-   COL/UCAR will accept funds approved by the Steering Committee from
    third party funder(s) in support of the Science Plan. UCAR will
    develop and execute agreements to achieve RWSC and funder outcomes
    and manage related activities.

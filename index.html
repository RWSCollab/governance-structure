<h1>RWSC Governance Structure</h1>
<section id="welcome" class="level2 unnumbered">
<h2 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="welcome">Welcome</h2>
<p>This document articulates a governance structure for the <a href="https://rwsc.org/">Regional Wildlife Science Collaborative for Offshore Wind</a> (RWSC) as a collaborative entity among four sectors – federal agencies, state agencies, environmental non-governmental organizations, and offshore wind companies. The structure and processes described in this document are meant to provide consistency in participation in RWSC where possible across sectors while also allowing necessary flexibility for each sector. This document and all of its sections will be reviewed and re-adopted annually by the Steering Committee.</p>
<hr>
<section id="mission" class="level3 unnumbered">
<h3 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="mission">Mission</h3>
<p>To collaboratively and effectively conduct and coordinate relevant, credible, and efficient regional monitoring and research of wildlife and marine ecosystems that supports the advancement of environmentally responsible and cost-efficient offshore wind power development activities in U.S. Atlantic waters.</p>
<p>RWSC is serving as a coordination hub for offshore wind research to increase collaboration, limit redundancy, suggest common data standards, and increase data sharing and transparency.</p>
</section>
<section id="scope" class="level3 unnumbered">
<h3 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="scope">Scope</h3>
<section id="geographic-area" class="level4 unnumbered">
<h4 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="geographic-area">Geographic Area</h4>
<p>The geographic scope includes waters along the Northeast and Southeast U.S. Continental Shelf in the areas where offshore wind development is being developed or is proposed. RWSC shares organizational lessons learned and makes available the science and data management recommendations that are pertinent to other U.S. regions (e.g., the west coast, Gulf of Mexico).</p>

<section id="wildlife-definition" class="level4 unnumbered">
<h4 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="wildlife-definition">Wildlife Definition</h4>
<p>“Wildlife” includes marine mammals, sea turtles, protected fish species and corals, birds, and bats. Additionally, for the purposes of RWSC, wildlife are part of a complex ecosystem of various trophic levels including all fisheries resources and benthic organisms, and oceanographic drivers upon which the aforementioned species depend.</p>
</section>
<section id="scope-of-inquiries" class="level4 unnumbered">
<h4 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="scope-of-inquiries">Scope of Inquiries</h4>
<p>The primary subject matter scope will initially include wildlife and habitats (e.g., marine mammals, sea turtles and birds, bats, protected fish species, corals, and the complex ecosystems in which affected wildlife exist). RWSC will seek to coordinate with entities such as Responsible Offshore Science Alliance (ROSA) on matters associated with fisheries and other topics of commercial interest.</p>

<section id="history" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="history">History &amp; Background</h2>
<p>The RWSC was formed in July 2021 following several years of planning, facilitated discussions, and working sessions that included representatives from the four sectors and other interested stakeholders. During the pre-2021 planning phase, many of the key components of the entity’s potential structure and governance were outlined in a collaborative document, <a href="https://neoceanplanning.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/RWSE_Vision_2020.pdf">Regional Wildlife Science Entity for Atlantic Offshore Wind: A Stakeholder Driven Vision</a>.</p>
<p>A voluntary interim Steering Committee was convened to inform the selection of a host entity and fiscal agent in early 2021. The Interim Steering Committee used the Vision document as a blueprint for the formation of the entity. When the Interim Steering Committee selected the Northeast Regional Ocean Council, Mid-Atlantic Regional Council on the Ocean, and Coastal States Stewardship Foundation as hosts and fiscal agent, they all collectively began implementing the governance structure as described in the Vision. The Interim Steering Committee transitioned to a full standing Steering Committee, leveraging all of the same individuals that had served as interim members. These members guided the formation of the four Sector Caucuses and six expert Subcommittees (Marine Mammals, Birds &amp; Bats, Sea Turtles, Habitat &amp; Ecosystem, Protected Fish Species, and Technology).</p>
<p>After approximately two years of collaboration and discussions with the research community, RWSC released the first <a href="http://rwsc.org/science-plan">Integrated Science Plan for Offshore Wind, Wildlife, and Habitat in U.S. Atlantic Waters</a> (“Science Plan”) in January 2024. The Science Plan aggregates research and data needs from across the sectors, and recommends data repositories and practices for data management that are specific to each type of research or data. In addition, the Science Plan describes a framework for collaboration among the sectors to support regional offshore wind and wildlife research and implement the recommendations in the Science Plan. One of the recommendations in the Science Plan is to convene a new Data Governance Subcommittee that will develop RWSC-wide policies for data management and sharing. With support from RWSC staff, the Steering Committee has convened this new Subcommittee in early 2024.</p>
<p>The Science Plan, including the framework for collaboration, and this Governance Structure, will continue to be used to guide the work of the RWSC.</p>

<ol type="1">
<li><p><a href="./index.html#framework">Framework for Collaboration</a> - A framework that describes the actions that the sectors can take to implement the Science Plan and use RWSC as a forum to collaborate on offshore wind and wildlife research.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="./index.html#steering">Steering Committee</a> - A group representing the key sectors. Provides guidance and direction for process and procedure of the RWSC overall, including to the Director and Subcommittees. Representatives are selected from Sector Caucuses. This section contains the Steering Committee Charter, to which all Steering Committee members agree.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="./index.html#sectors">Sector Caucuses</a> <strong>–</strong> Sector Caucuses provide input to the Steering Committee to ensure progress on strategic research on offshore wind and wildlife topics. Participation in Sector Caucuses involves regular virtual meetings and discussions within sectors (e.g.&nbsp;offshore wind industry; state government; federal government; and non-governmental environmental organizations). Each Sector Caucus has developed its own Framework to guide the creation and use of their caucus including a clear definition of membership or participation:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="./index.html#industry">Offshore Wind Industry Caucus Framework</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="./index.html#state">State Caucus Framework</a></p></li>

<li><p><a href="./index.html#engo">eNGO Caucus Framework</a></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><a href="./index.html#subcommittees">Subcommittees</a> <strong>–</strong> Subcommittees are the core groups that identify key gaps and needs, scope initial research concepts initially, and help maintain alignment between ongoing research and the gaps and needs of the RWSC. Subcommittees are convened as needed. This section contains the generic Subcommittee Terms of Reference. RWSC staff also maintain a specific Terms document for each Subcommittee (referenced within).</p></li>
<li><p><a href="./index.html#staff">Director, Other Staff, and Partners</a> <strong>–</strong> Staff employed by RWSC with appropriate skills and competencies. The Director conducts day-to-day management of RWSC including planning events, coordinating the committees, brokering funding and in selected cases, managing research contracts. Partners are organizations who operate within the geographic area of interest and have objectives similar to those of the RWSC and/or complementary expertise.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="./index.html#ops">RWSC Operations Host and Fiscal Agent</a> <strong>-</strong> A Host/Fiscal Agent with functional administrative capacities that provides key functions for RWSC for a reasonable overhead cost.

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="framework">1. Framework for Collaboration</h2>
<p>The voluntary framework for collaboration among the RWSC sectors has three primary goals:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Promote coordination of regional offshore wind related wildlife research with the RWSC, regardless of funding source, recipient(s), or funding structure.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure that data collection and research methods and products (i) meet the needs of decision-makers, (ii) are scientifically sound, (iii) standardized, and (iv) made available for use as soon as feasible or appropriate to inform and improve decision-making.</p></li>
<li><p>Communicate the findings and results of individual and collaborative research.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>RWSC welcomes and encourages participation from all entities and individuals in implementing this Science Plan, especially via expert Subcommittee meetings. To assist in the implementation of the Science Plan, the RWSC will maintain the&nbsp;<a href="https://database.rwsc.org/">Offshore Wind &amp; Wildlife Research Database</a>&nbsp;and continue to provide tools and forums for research planning, discussions, and collaboration among all participants. All are encouraged to participate in implementing the Science Plan by:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Maintaining situational awareness of data collection and research activities to identify opportunities for collaboration, consistency, and efficiency.</strong> This can be accomplished in part by participating regularly in RWSC Sector Caucus and expert Subcommittee meetings and by encouraging relevant grantees, contractors, and researchers to share project information with the RWSC. Several RWSC participants have noted the value of Subcommittee meetings as forums for sharing research plans, discussing emerging issues, and working together across sectors to advance Science Plan objectives. The Subcommittees will continue to meet regularly to share information on the latest study results, ongoing and planned research and data collection, and to periodically review data management infrastructure needs and workflows. Entities will be able to coordinate as needed with the relevant RWSC Subcommittee(s) prior to new data collection (to ensure consistency and reduce duplication) and analysis (to facilitate access to the available data) and share details about where and when activities take place to avoid conflicts. The RWSC will facilitate this objective via the&nbsp;<a href="https://database.rwsc.org/">Offshore Wind &amp; Wildlife Research Database</a>, web mapping tools, and a data catalog (in development).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Collaboratively implementing and encouraging the use of best practices for data collection, QA/QC, data management, and storage as specified in this Science Plan.</strong> Each Subcommittee has recommended practices for each relevant data type or data collection method in the Science Plan. To encourage uptake and consistent use of these practices, the RWSC will provide suggested language, agreed to by the Sector Caucuses, around data management for participants to use in their own requests for proposals and agreements.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Participating in annual discussions of research priorities.</strong> The RWSC provides a forum to identify data and research needs based on current data gaps, new research results, emerging decision-making needs, and available funding. To facilitate an adaptive approach to prioritizing the recommendations in the Science Plan, RWSC will convene the sectors each year to review and discuss research priorities. Discussions will be informed by the expert Subcommittees’ work, collaborative workshops, and agreed upon prioritization criteria.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Aligning funds and developing collaborative funding plans.</strong> Through annual research prioritization discussions, the RWSC will provide opportunities for participants to voluntarily align their existing research funds to address Science Plan objectives when it makes sense to do so. The RWSC also provides a mechanism for pooling funds to accomplish shared priorities when practical, administering funds, and managing research projects that accomplish Science Plan goals.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="steering" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="steering">2. Steering Committee Charter</h2>
<p><strong><em>What.</em></strong> The Steering Committee will provide governance and oversight on the processes and procedures of the RWSC. The Steering Committee will be the final decision-making body on process, financial, and procedural governance of the RWSC.</p>
<p><strong><em>Key Functions.</em></strong> The Steering Committee will meet via teleconference at least quarterly and will exchange communications with the Director and each other via email on a more frequent basis. The Steering Committee provides general guidance and oversight to the Subcommittees, Fiscal Agent and Director, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Liaise with existing and related science efforts that Steering Committee members may be part of</p></li>
<li><p>Establish and maintain two-way communication with sectors on RWSC progress, development, and direction</p></li>
<li><p>Provide guidance to the Director on refining near-term objectives for the RWSC</p></li>
<li><p>Provide criteria for how and what kind of research the RWSC supports</p></li>
<li><p>Provide oversight on the establishment of funding of the operations of the RWSC</p></li>
<li><p>Establish roles and approaches to membership for Subcommittees</p></li>
<li><p>Based on Subcommittee recommendation, approve plans to align research with gaps and needs assessment</p></li>
<li><p>Provide input on cross-cutting issues like data standardization, stressors and impacts as needed</p></li>
<li><p>With support and assistance from RWSC staff, lead regular Caucus discussions</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Number and composition.</em></strong> The Steering Committee will include a maximum of twelve (12) members, composed of three (3) representatives each from the four sectors listed below. Members will be nominated by their respective Sector Caucus to represent that Caucus on the Steering Committee.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><p>wind energy developers and lease-holders</p></li>
<li><p>environmental nonprofits</p></li>
<li><p>federal agencies, and</p></li>
<li><p>states</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To the extent possible and/or practical, members of the Steering Committee will be representative of the full geographic region encompassed by the RWSC. Steering Committee members should have influence on the strategy, objectives, and/or resources of their organization.</p>
<p><strong><em>Term.</em></strong> Every member will serve for a maximum three (3) year term, which will begin immediately upon acceptance of this Governance Structure by the Interim Steering Committee. Each Sector Caucus has defined processes and considerations for selecting and maintaining their leadership (see <a href="./index.html#sectors">Sector Caucus Frameworks</a>), with support and assistance from RWSC staff.&nbsp; Should an individual Steering Committee member exit the Committee before their term ends, the Sector Caucus will appoint a replacement representative to fill the remainder of that term.</p>
<p><strong><em>Decision-making.</em></strong> Steering Committee decisions are made by consensus - no sector can “out vote” or form a “winning coalition” against another sector.</p>
<p>The Steering Committee intends to collectively make decisions about which research to fund using the Science Plan, which articulates shared research priorities, and through the establishment of an RWSC Offshore Wind and Wildlife Research Fund. It is likely that Science Plan recommendations will be funded by a combination of individual entities that collaborate via RWSC and by funding provided to the RWSC Offshore Wind and Wildlife Research Fund specifically for Science Plan implementation. Funds provided to RWSC may be pooled from several individual sources. For funds provided to RWSC, funding decisions will reside with the Steering Committee, informed by the expert Subcommittees and Science Plan, considering any limitations on the use of funds, and funders’ priorities.</p>
<p><strong><em>Steering Committee Member Responsibilities.</em></strong> General responsibilities for representatives on the Steering Committee include:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>With support from RWSC staff, provide a forum for Sector Caucus members to meet and discuss items either to be raised to the Steering Committee, or that have been raised by the Steering Committee.</p></li>
<li><p>Attend and meaningfully contribute to regular virtual discussions (at minimum, quarterly). If a Steering Committee member is unable to join a discussion, they may appoint a replacement representative from their organization to attend in their stead.</p></li>
<li><p>Speak on behalf of their sector caucus, not just their individual organization.</p></li>
<li><p>Be willing to engage in collaborative, cross-sector deliberations; and</p></li>
<li><p>Contribute resources to the operating needs of RWSC as determined through coordination with the Director.</p></li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sectors">3. Sector Caucuses</h2>
<p>Sector caucuses will involve standing meetings and listserv discussions within sectors. Sector caucuses will be created for the <strong>following four sectors: wind energy developers and lease-holders; state government; federal government; and environmental non-governmental organizations (eNGOs).</strong> Each sector has developed a Framework to guide participation, membership, and leadership of that caucus. Each sector’s Frameworks are included below. Current caucus rosters will be posted and updated on the RWSC website.</p>
<p><strong><em>Key Functions.</em></strong> The sector caucuses will serve several purposes for the RWSC. Their overall role is to provide input to the Steering Committee to ensure progress on strategic research on offshore wind and wildlife topics.&nbsp; Each Caucus developed their own Frameworks with responsibilities outlined, but the general function of the sector caucuses include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Select three (3) members from their Caucus to represent the Caucus on the Steering Committee. Each Steering Committee member will serve a maximum three (3) year term. Each Caucus should address Steering Committee membership individually and may have different criteria or methods for designating Steering Committee members.</p></li>
<li><p>Identify and sustain an approach to provide funding for the operations of the RWSC.</p></li>
<li><p>Provide a forum for all sector members to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Engage, share, learn, and keep abreast of RWSC work.</p></li>
<li><p>Identify sector opportunities, issues or concerns that can be raised to the Steering Committee via Steering Committee sectoral representatives.</p></li>
<li><p>Allow Steering Committee representatives to pose questions, issues, and ideas from the Steering Committee to the sectors.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Who</em>.</strong> The current list of Caucus members is on the RWSC website. Membership is meant to be clear but not onerous or overly formal. Members need only to agree to support the general mission and principles of the RWSC and to participate and engage in their caucus and in periodic or occasional RWSC activities or events. If members participate in scoping and conceptual approaches to research, they could be precluded from bidding on work or precluded in playing a role in final procurements and selection processes. The Steering Committee has developed a <a href="https://rwscollab.github.io/coi-policy/">Conflict of Interest Policy</a> applicable to all members to address this issue.</p>
<p><strong><em>Number</em>.</strong> The number of caucus members may vary by sector, however, should be manageable enough to facilitate efficient yet comprehensive input.</p>
<p><strong><em>Decision-making.</em></strong> The caucuses have an option to utilize Consensus Procedure. Each caucus’ decision-making process is specified in their individual Frameworks.</p>
<p><strong><em>Criteria for Membership.</em></strong> While each Caucus will develop its own framework for operating, in general, caucus members should be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Attend meetings.</strong> Attend and actively participate in regular caucus meetings;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Complete follow-up work.</strong> Complete any follow up actions or reviews as determined through caucus meetings;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Attend events.</strong> Participate in RWSC events as required, but not envisaged to exceed more than two events annually (events may include state of the science meetings and research funding prioritization meetings);</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Communicate with sector.</strong> Ensure partners are well informed of current and relevant advancements;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Provide expert guidance.</strong> Provide ad hoc guidance on projects.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Financial Contribution to RWSC Operating Budget</em></strong></p>
<p>For at least the next few fiscal years, there is a need for financial support of RWSC operations which includes convening all RWSC members and stakeholders (Steering Committee, four Sector Caucuses, Subcommittees) and developing science plans/research agendas that describe data needs and research priorities with each taxa-based Subcommittee. The Annual Work Plan describes the scope of this work and the services provided by RWSC staff, along with a budget. The Annual Work Plan and FY 2022 budget was approved by the RWSC interim Steering Committee in September 2021.</p>
<p>The RWSC Governance Structure encourages members from the four Sector Caucuses to contribute to the operational costs of the RWSC, in the form of financial or documented in-kind contributions. Each Caucus is developing a contribution model. Financial contributions to the RWSC annual operating budget are not required but are strongly encouraged.</p>
<p><strong><em>Financial Contribution to RWSC Offshore Wind and Wildlife Research Fund</em></strong></p>
<p>As of March 2024, a Research Budget has not been developed. With the finalization of the RWSC Science Plan in January of 2024, the Caucus expects to discuss research funding prioritization among themselves and with other Caucuses throughout in 2024.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Conflict of Interest</em></strong></p>
<p>The RWSC Steering Committee has developed a <a href="https://rwscollab.github.io/coi-policy/">Conflict of Interest Policy</a> that all Sector Caucus members are expected to comply with. For example, if members participate in scoping and conceptual approaches to research, they could be precluded from bidding on work or precluded in playing a role in final procurements and selection processes. RWSC Staff, Steering Committee members, and Subcommittee members are all subject to the same policy.</p>

<p><strong><em>Offshore Wind Industry Caucus Definitions</em></strong></p>
<p>The table below briefly summarizes a membership and leadership model for the Offshore Wind Industry Caucus developed in late 2021 and refined in early 2023. Each component is further described in the following sections. This is the first membership model implemented by the Caucus and it was designed to be flexible in the first year of RWSC operations. The Caucus will reevaluate this model at least annually and more frequently as needed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>*<em>Entities have US Atlantic offshore wind lease interests, the intent to obtain a US Atlantic offshore wind lease interest(s)/eligible bidders, as well as US Atlantic entities without a lease interest.</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Offshore Wind Industry Caucus Membership</em></strong></p>
<p>The RWSC Offshore Wind Industry Caucus welcomes membership and participation from all levels of the industry from entities with interests or potential interests in the Atlantic coast region and that support the general mission and principles of the RWSC.</p>
<p>For the purposes of Offshore Wind Industry Caucus Membership, an “entity” should:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Have US Atlantic offshore wind lease interests, or</p></li>
<li><p>Have the intent to obtain a US Atlantic offshore wind lease interest(s), or</p></li>
<li><p>Be an eligible bidder on a US Atlantic offshore wind lease, or</p></li>
<li><p>Hold no current lease interest but express a commitment to understanding offshore wind and wildlife research and how it can advance the industry&nbsp;</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It is understood that a single entity may fit into one or more of the entity categories described above or change categories throughout the term of their Caucus participation. Membership of a Joint Venture in RWSC does not confer individual Membership status to its parent companies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each Caucus Member will designate a primary staff member and an alternate to represent the entity in Caucus discussions and voting. Primary and alternate Members will be added to the Caucus mailing list and receive invites to all Caucus meetings. Members will be provided access to relevant Caucus documents and other materials.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Caucus Members are expected to participate in regular meetings and complete any follow up actions or reviews as determined through those meetings. It is also expected that Caucus Members participate in RWSC events as required, but not envisaged to exceed more than two events annually (events may include a State of the Science Workshop or Annual Forums).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Members will be added to the Caucus mailing list and receive invites to all Caucus meetings. In consultation with Caucus leadership, Members will be provided access to relevant Caucus documents and other materials.</p>
<p><strong><em>Offshore Wind Industry Caucus Membership</em></strong></p>
<p>Caucus Members have US Atlantic coast business interests, have voting status, and are eligible for roles on the Steering Committee. Financial contribution to the RWSC annual operating budget is a consideration but not a requirement for Steering Committee eligibility. Financial contribution to the RWSC annual operation budget by Caucus Members is strongly encouraged.</p>
<p><strong><em>Maintaining existing Offshore Wind Industry Caucus Member information</em></strong></p>
<p>This Offshore Wind Industry Caucus Framework recognizes that Member entities’ statuses will likely change over time, including changes in ownership, the formation of new joint ventures, and other changes. Member entities will notify RWSC staff and Caucus leadership about changes to entity name, status, or representation on the Caucus.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Offshore Wind Industry - Onboarding new Members</em></strong></p>
<p>RWSC Staff will work with Caucus leadership to review new Caucus Membership requests to ensure that new entities’ interests are consistent with this Framework and the RWSC Mission. As appropriate and as determined by the Caucus leads, the Caucus may vote on the inclusion of any new entity to the Caucus.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Offshore Wind Industry Caucus Voting</em></strong></p>
<p>This Framework recognizes that Caucus Members will represent overlapping and duplicative interests. As such, the Caucus will make consensus-based decisions to the extent practicable. On feedback and advice on substantive issues, the Caucus may report a range of views if the Members are not in general agreement. Voting procedures will be used when determined necessary by Caucus leadership. Caucus members (entities that provide financial contributions to the RWSC operations budget) have voting status.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Offshore Wind Industry Caucus Leadership – Steering Committee Eligibility</em></strong></p>
<p>Caucus Members are eligible for roles as Caucus leads and to represent the Caucus on the Steering Committee. The Caucus will select Members to represent the Caucus on the Steering Committee for a term of three years. One Steering Committee position will rotate each other year, so that terms are staggered.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Three primary Caucus leads/Steering Committee members must be selected by Caucus Members. Each selected Caucus lead/Steering Committee member should also designate an alternate from their entity. Alternates may join Steering Committee voting procedures only if the primary member is unable to participate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>Caucus Members may consider the following factors when they determine the balance of Caucus representation on the Steering Committee:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Entity type (lease holder, developer, other)&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>Entity’s relationship(s) with other potential Caucus leads/Steering Committee members’ entities&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>Geographic scope of entity’s interests&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>Contributions to RWSC annual operating budget</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Members of the Caucus will nominate Steering Committee representatives as positions on the Steering Committee become available. Representatives will be chosen by blind vote.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>Responsibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Represent the entire Offshore Wind Industry Sector Caucus in Steering Committee meetings and discussions. This includes discussions and decisions regarding RWSC operations, research prioritization, and funding.&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>Serve as Caucus leads: Caucus representatives on the RWSC Steering Committee are expected to lead and coordinate the Caucus. Administrative support (e.g., taking notes, developing draft meeting summaries, drafting other caucus materials) will be provided by RWSC Staff.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>Communicate with Caucus Members: Steering Committee members are responsible for coordinating, soliciting, and collating the review, discussion, and input of the entire Caucus on any documents, information, or other decisions conveyed by RWSC staff&nbsp;</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Offshore Wind Industry Caucus - Financial Contribution Structure (RWSC operating budget only)</em></strong></p>
<p>Financial contributions to the RWSC annual operating budget are not required but are strongly encouraged. For at least the next few fiscal years, there is a need for financial support of RWSC operations which includes convening all RWSC members and stakeholders (i.e., Steering Committee, four Sector Caucuses, six Subcommittees) and developing science plans/research agendas that describe data needs and research priorities with each taxa-based Subcommittee. The <a href="http://rwsc.org/about">Annual Work Plan</a> describes the scope of this work and the services provided by RWSC staff, along with a budget.</p>
<p>The RWSC Governance Structure encourages members from the four Sector Caucuses to contribute to the operational costs of the RWSC, in the form of financial or documented in-kind contributions. Each Caucus is developing a contribution model.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since July 2022, the Offshore Wind Industry Caucus has sought to fund up to 33% of the RWSC operations budget. This has translated to an annual contribution of $20,000 per entity. This contribution will be recalculated annually based on budget projections and the total number of member entities. As such, the contribution per entity will be reduced as more members join the Caucus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Contributions will be invoiced to each entity annually as Membership Dues. Members joining mid-year will be invoiced for the minimum contribution for that fiscal year. An optional renewal for each fiscal year (which begins on July 1) will be sent each June.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Offshore Wind Industry Caucus - Financial Contribution to RWSC Offshore Wind and Wildlife Research Fund</em></strong></p>
<p>As of March 2024, a Research Budget has not been developed. With the finalization of the RWSC Science Plan in January of 2024, the Caucus expects to discuss research funding prioritization among themselves and with other Caucuses throughout in 2024.&nbsp;</p>

<section id="terms-of-reference" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="terms-of-reference">Terms of Reference</h3>
<p><strong><em>Purpose.</em></strong> RWSC Subcommittees provide topic-area scientific and technical experts from academia, state government, NGOs, and industry to the Steering Committee. Subcommittees will initially be set up by taxon (see below), and may be created, rearranged, combined, and/or reconstituted as issues arise. RWSC Subcommittees will be connected to existing NROC/MARCO Marine Life Work Groups such that they are distinct but complementary, with beneficial overlap in membership towards streamlining workflows such that research prioritization and data collection result in shared data products that support decision-making and adaptive management and vice-versa. RWSC Subcommittees and NROC/MARCO Marine Life Work Groups may hold joint meetings when it is beneficial to advancing offshore wind monitoring/assessment topics.</p>
<p><strong><em>Responsibilities.</em></strong> Each Subcommittee will meet virtually 2-3 times per year, and more frequently when planning workshops, and coordinate with other Subcommittees on common research and monitoring topics prior to recommendations on research. The RWSC Coordinator will provide support to Subcommittees in coordinating meetings. Subcommittee members will contribute to a data/research gaps and needs assessment for their Subcommittee. Subcommittees review existing research and data and identify gaps and needs pertinent to offshore wind development and wildlife. Subcommittees may support scoping conceptual research projects that would address the gaps and needs. Subcommittees submit recommendations on gaps and needs and potential projects to the Steering Committee.</p>
<p><strong><em>Membership.</em></strong> The Director will maintain a list of potential organizations for membership in each Subcommittee for input and approval by the Steering Committee. Invitations are issued to selected organizations (not necessarily those who are already part of the RWSC via other representation) who would self-appoint individuals based on guidance drafted by the Steering Committee. Subcommittee members must have working knowledge of ongoing and pending wildlife and offshore wind research as well as recent studies, workshops, and other efforts to identify and prioritize research needs. Subcommittee member numbers and numbers by sectors are less subject to exact requirements as long as there is the necessary scientific expertise included and all sectors’ interests are meaningfully represented.</p>
<p><strong><em>Subcommittees.</em></strong> Other Subcommittees may be formed when a specific issue or topic has been identified as a research priority.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Marine mammals</p></li>
<li><p>Sea turtles</p></li>
<li><p>Birds and bats</p></li>
<li><p>Protected fish species</p></li>
<li><p>Habitat and ecosystem</p></li>
<li><p>Technology</p></li>
<li><p>Data Governance</p></li>
<li><p>Other taxa-specific or cross-cutting issues as they arise</p></li>

<p><strong><em>Conflicts of Interest.</em></strong> If experts participate in scoping and conceptual approaches to research, they could be precluded from bidding on work or precluded in playing a role in final procurements and selection processes. The Steering Committee has developed a <a href="https://rwscollab.github.io/coi-policy/">Conflict of Interest Policy</a> which will apply to all Subcommittees to address this issue.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="staff">5. Director, Other Staff, and Partners</h2>
<p><strong><em>What</em></strong>. The Director plays a leadership role and has both scientific and strong relationship and project management skills. The Director will coordinate with the Host/Fiscal Agent, other staff, and partners. The Steering Committee will assist the Director in determining what additional staff and/or consultants may be needed over time to both stand up the RWSC and deliver on projects, as funding becomes available. As the volume of work grows, this position may be divided between a Science Director and a Process Director.</p>
<p><strong><em>Key Functions.</em></strong> Selected functions of the Director and other staff are outlined below.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Organize all events or workshops, conduct initial research on data and science gaps, and organize all communications and facilitation amongst the steering committee, sub-committees, stakeholders, and general public.</p></li>
<li><p>Key role in helping the sectors and organizations identify funding for key gaps and needs, including brokering partnerships or joint funding for projects of interest.</p></li>
<li><p>Conduct communications and marketing, including using targeted tools.</p></li>
<li><p>In selected cases in which the RWSC is procuring and contracting research, the Director and staff would provide contract management</p></li>
<li><p>Support the Subcommittees and Steering Committee with an initial screening of potential research projects based on the objectives of the RWSC (e.g.&nbsp;regional, data standardization, data transparency, etc.)</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Who.</em></strong> The Director will have at least a master’s or PhD in wildlife biology, marine resource management, marine ecology, public policy, environmental planning, or closely related disciplines.</p>
<p><strong><em>Other Staff.</em></strong> A variety of functions/roles will be needed to support the Director and Steering Committee (outreach/engagement, technical, accounting, legal, communications, etc.), for which additional staff may be required.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em><strong>Coordinator</strong>.</em> The RWSC Coordinator will directly support the RWSC Director and Steering Committee to advance the RWSC work plan. The Coordinator will assist the Director in managing contracts and work plans, convening the Sector Caucuses and Subcommittees, conduct additional as-needed outreach to existing and potential new partners, identify potential sources of funding, and support the Steering Committee.&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>In consultation with the Steering Committee, staff may be directly hired through the Host/Fiscal Agent, or by partnering with other organizations such as universities, consultants, or other organizations.&nbsp;</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Partners.</em></strong> Organizations, as determined by the Host/Fiscal Agent and Director, in consultation with the Steering Committee, who operate within the geographic area of interest and have objectives similar to those of the RWSC and/or complementary expertise, and who:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Can provide coordination and other capacity</p></li>
<li><p>Have a role in advancing the objectives of any Subcommittee</p></li>
<li><p>May provide staff via contractual or other means</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ops">6. RWSC Operations Hosts and Fiscal Agent</h2>
<p>The Hosts and Fiscal Agent provide the core administrative and financial functions of RWSC. In April 2021, the Interim Steering Committee selected the Northeast Regional Ocean Council (NROC), Mid-Atlantic Regional Council on the Ocean (MARCO), and Coastal States Stewardship Foundation (CSSF) as hosts and fiscal agent for RWSC.</p>
<p>As hosts of RWSC, NROC and MARCO, supported by CSSF as their fiscal agent, have responsibility for the programmatic, contractual, staffing, fiscal, and legal oversight of the entity. As such, NROC and MARCO support the RWSC Steering Committee in implementing the RWSC mission. NROC and MARCO are responsible for the hiring of a Director in consultation with the Steering Committee. NROC and MARCO provide appropriate oversight of the Director’s work to manage the RWSC budget, contracts, grants, and staffing to ensure that RWSC has sufficient capacity such that regional wildlife and offshore wind research, grant and contract, and fiscal administrative objectives can be met.</p>
<p>CSSF, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit entity, serves as RWSC’s fiscal agent, consistent with Memoranda of Understanding with NROC and MARCO. In practice this means that CSSF is the vehicle through which staffing, contracts, and grants for RWSC are executed and managed. CSSF will receive and remit payments on behalf of RWSC for services rendered and funds received. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Providing a vehicle to maintain operating funding – funds received by members for implementing the RWSC Annual Work Plan</p></li>
<li><p>In selected cases, accepting and pooling funds from multiple sources for research</p></li>
<li><p>Procure and contract for research as needed</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="research" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="research">7. RWSC Offshore Wind and Wildlife Research Fund Fiscal Agent</h2>
<p>A Research Fund Fiscal Agent provides the administrative and financial functions of the Research Fund, including developing and executing agreements with funders, holding and potentially pooling large sums of funding from multiple sources, and developing, executing, and managing contractual agreements with multiple types of entities to conduct research. In July 2023, the Steering Committee developed a <a href="https://rwsc.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/RWSC-UCAR-COL-20230721-MOU-Fully-Executed.pdf">Memorandum of Understanding</a> (MOU) with the Center for Ocean Leadership (COL) to collaborate on the administrative, fiscal, and program management functions needed to implement the RWSC Offshore Wind and Wildlife Research Fund on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p>The Center for Ocean Leadership became a University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR) Community Program in 2022 to support the ongoing work of the ocean science community. It is a convener and coordinator for ocean science, working with more than 85 affiliated institutions and federal agencies across the government. Center for Ocean Leadership-affiliated institutions span the academic, industry, and nonprofit sectors engaged in ocean science, technology development, and public education.</p>
<p>The roles and responsibilities of RWSC and UCAR/COL in implementing the Research Fund are detailed in the <a href="https://rwsc.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/RWSC-UCAR-COL-20230721-MOU-Fully-Executed.pdf">MOU</a>. Briefly:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>RWSC will serve in a technical, programmatic oversight, and decision-making role for identifying funding sources, approving the acceptance of funds, and selecting projects for funding with the purpose of implementing the RWSC Science Plan.</p></li>
<li><p>COL/UCAR may accept funds approved by the Steering Committee from third party funder(s) in support of the Science Plan. At the direction of the Steering Committee, UCAR may develop and execute agreements to achieve RWSC and funder outcomes and manage related activities.</p></li>
</ul>
